AD331 assignment on Prompt Engineering for Performance Improvement. Includes baseline prompt, three techniques (role, formatting, chain‑of‑thought), evaluation, and final optimized prompt with notebook, README, and video demo.

Prompt Engineering for Performance Improvement – AD331 Assignment

This repository contains my AD331 course assignment on Prompt Engineering for Performance Improvement. The project demonstrates how different prompt design techniques can significantly improve large language model outputs.

Contents:

Prompt_Eng_System.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook showing:

Baseline prompt run

Three iterative techniques (Role prompting, Output formatting, Chain‑of‑Thought)

Qualitative evaluation of outputs

Final optimized prompt

README.md → Documentation with comparison table and lessons learned

Supporting files for rubric alignment and reproducibility

Deliverables:

Notebook with baseline, techniques, and final prompt

GitHub documentation with analysis

Video demo walkthrough (5–7 minutes) uploaded to YouTube

Learning Outcomes:

Understand how prompt engineering impacts accuracy, format, and style

Apply iterative improvements to achieve rubric‑aligned results

Communicate findings through reproducible code and clear documentation
