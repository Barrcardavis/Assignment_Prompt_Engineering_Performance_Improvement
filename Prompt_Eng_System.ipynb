    "(Amazon Leo Satellite Constellation)\n",
    "Satellite internet constellations are large networks of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites designed to deliver global broadband coverage. Unlike geostationary satellites that orbit at 35,000 kilometers, LEO satellites operate much closer to Earth — typically between 500 and 1,200 kilometers. This lower altitude reduces latency and improves connection speeds, making them ideal for real-time applications such as video conferencing, online gaming, and cloud services. By deploying thousands of satellites, these constellations can provide connectivity to remote and underserved regions where terrestrial infrastructure is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most prominent projects are Amazon Leo and SpaceX’s Starlink. Amazon recently rebranded its Project Kuiper initiative as Amazon Leo, highlighting its focus on LEO deployment. The constellation has regulatory approval for 3,236 satellites and has already launched more than 150 units into orbit, with plans to scale rapidly through 2030. Amazon Leo is tightly integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering enterprise-grade connectivity solutions. Its new Leo Ultra terminals deliver speeds up to 1 Gbps download and 400 Mbps upload, positioning the service for industries that demand high reliability. Starlink, meanwhile, has deployed thousands of satellites and emphasizes rapid consumer rollout, with service already available in dozens of countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond consumer internet, these constellations have broader implications for industries and governments. Amazon Leo is already running enterprise trials with partners such as JetBlue, Hunt Energy, and Connected Farms, demonstrating use cases in aviation, energy, and agriculture. Satellite constellations also support logistics, maritime operations, and disaster response by ensuring connectivity where traditional networks fail. At the same time, they raise challenges around orbital congestion, spectrum allocation, and long-term sustainability in space. Balancing innovation with responsible deployment will be critical as these systems expand."
